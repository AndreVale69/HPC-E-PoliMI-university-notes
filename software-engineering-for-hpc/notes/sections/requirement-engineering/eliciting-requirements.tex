\subsection{Eliciting requirements}

The \definition{Requirements Elicitation} is the \textbf{practice of researching and discovering the requirements of a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders}. The \textbf{goal} of requirements elicitation is to ensure that the software development process is based on a clear and comprehensive understanding of the customer's needs and requirements. To do that, exist a simple and effective tool called \definition{scenario}s.

\begin{definitionbox}
    A \definition{scenario} is a concrete, focused, informal description of a single feature of the system to be.
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{examplebox}[: warehouse on fire]
    \emph{Bob driving down main street in his patrol car notices smoke coming out of a warehouse. His partner, Alice, reports the emergency from her car.}

    \highspace
    \emph{Alice enters the address of the building, a brief description of its location (i.e. north west corner), and an emergency level. In addition to a fire unit, she requests several paramedic units on the scene given that area appears to be relatively busy. She confirms her input and waits for an acknowledgment.}

    \highspace
    \emph{John, the Dispatcher, is alerted to the emergency by a beep of his workstation. He reviews the information submitted by Alice and acknowledges the report. He allocates a fire unit and two paramedic units to the incident site and sends their estimated time of arrival (ETA) to Alice.}

    \highspace
    \emph{Alice received the acknowledgment and the ETA.}
\end{examplebox}
There are heuristics for finding scenarios, such as asking the customer a few questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which user groups are supported by the system to perform their work?
    \item What are the primary tasks that the system needs to perform?
    \item What data will the actor create, store, change, remove or add in the system?
    \item What external changes does the system need to know about?
    \item What changes or events will the actor of the system need to be informed about?
\end{itemize}
However, it's very important \underline{not} \textbf{to rely on questionnaires alone}! \textbf{Insist on task observation} (if possible), ask to \textbf{speak to the end user}, not just the software contractor, and expect resistance, but try to overcome it.

\newpage

\noindent
Scenarios provide a nice summary of what the requirements analysis team can derive from observation, interviews, analysis of documentation. By generalizing the scenarios, we can get \definition{Use Cases}.

\highspace
To specify a use case, it's very important to follow the following scheme.
\begin{definitionbox}[: Use Cases Schema]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Name of Use Case}
        
        \item \textbf{Actors}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Description of Actors involved in use case}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Entry condition}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \dquotes{\emph{When this use case starts the following condition is true...}}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Flow of Events}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Free form, informal natural language}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Exit condition}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \dquotes{\emph{This use case terminates when the following condition holds...}}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Exceptions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Describe what happens if things go wrong}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Special Requirements}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Nonfunctional Requirements, Constraints}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definitionbox}

\noindent
The following \textbf{suggestions} are useful in defining an appropriate use case:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use cases named with verbs that indicate what the user is trying to accomplish
    \item Actors named with nouns
    \item Use cases steps in active voice
    \item The causal relationship between steps should be clear
    \item A use case per user transaction
    \item Separate description of exceptions
    \item Keep use cases small (no more than two/three pages)
    \item The steps accomplished by actors and those accomplished by the system should be clearly distinguished (this helps us in identifying the boundaries of the system)
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\noindent
First of all, we present an example of a \textbf{bad use case}.
\begin{examplebox}[: bad use case]
    \example{Example} of a bad use case referring to the ambulance dispatching example on page~\pageref{example: ambulance dispatching system}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use case name: Accident
        \item Participating Actors:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Field Officer
        \end{itemize}
        \item Flow of Events:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The Field Officer reports the accident
            \item An ambulance is dispatched
            \item The Dispatcher is notified when the ambulance arrives on site
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    The \underline{errors} are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the \emph{use case name} field, the \textbf{word is a noun}. It's better to use a verb that indicates what the user is trying to achieve.
        
        \item The Dispatcher actor is \textbf{not declared} in the \emph{Participating Actors} field, but is mentioned in the \emph{Flow of Events} field.

        \item There are two main errors in the \emph{Flow of Events} section: the first is in the sentence \dquotes{\emph{An ambulance is dispatched}}. But \textbf{who sends it?} The second is in the third sentence, because \textbf{who notifies the Dispatcher?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{examplebox}
