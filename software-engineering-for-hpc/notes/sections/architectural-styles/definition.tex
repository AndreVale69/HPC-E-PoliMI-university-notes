\section{Architectural styles}

\subsection{Definition}

\begin{definitionbox}
    An architectural style determines the \textbf{vocabulary} of \textbf{components} and \textbf{connectors} that can be used in instances of that style, together with a set of \textbf{constraints} on how they can be combined.

    \highspace
    These can include topological constraints on architectural descriptions (e.g., no cycles). Other constraints - say, having to do with execution semantics - might also be part of the style definition.
