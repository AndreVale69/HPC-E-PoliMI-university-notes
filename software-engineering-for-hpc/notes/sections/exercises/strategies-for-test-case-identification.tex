\subsection{Strategies for test case identification}

\subsubsection{Triangles}

\descriptionproblem
Consider a function with the following signature:
\begin{center}
    \texttt{bool isTriangle(float a, float b, float c)}
\end{center}
The function receives three integers representing the lengths of three segments. The function returns true if the three segments can constitute the sides of a triangle and false otherwise.

\questionproblem
Assume we have the following test cases and corresponding output:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a = 10$, $b = 12$, $c = 9$, result \texttt{true}
    \item $a = 10$, $b = 12$, $c = 22$, result \texttt{false}
\end{itemize}
Identify one or more metamorphic relations between inputs and outputs and some corresponding test cases.

\solution
We can identify at least the following two \textbf{Metamorphic Relations} predicating on the sides of a triangle:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Relation between the sides of a triangle}: the length of each side of a triangle is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
    
    \item \emph{Similarity}: two triangles, A and B, are said to be similar if their side pairs are proportional.
\end{enumerate}
The corresponding test cases are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item By exploiting the first relation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a = 12$, $b = 9$, $c = 10$, result \texttt{true}
        \item $a = 12$, $b = 22$, $c = 10$, result \texttt{false}
    \end{itemize}

    \item By exploiting the similarity:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a = 5$, $b = 6$, $c = 4.5$, result \texttt{true}
        \item $a = 100$, $b = 120$, $c = 90$, result \texttt{true}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
