# (2023/2024) Applied Statistics

## Course Program

According to the official course syllabus:

1. ***Exploring a multivariate dataset***. Descriptive statistics and graphical displays. The geometry of a multivariate sample. Sample mean, covariance and correlation. Generalized variance and total variance. The metric induced by the covariance matrix.
2. ***Data representation and dimensional reduction***. The analysis of the covariance structure, principal component analysis (PCA).
3. ***Discrimination, classification, clustering***. Statistical classification: model, misclassification costs and prior probability. Bayesian supervised classification and the Fisher approach to discriminant analysis. Cross-validation for the evaluation of a classification function. Alternative approaches to classification: CART, support vector machines. Similarity measures. Unsupervised classification; hierarchical and nonhierarchical methods. DBSCAN. K-means and K-medoids. Multidimensional scaling.
4. ***Inference about mean vectors***. The multivariate normal distribution, the Wishart distribution, the F distribution. Hotelling $T^2$ test. Confidence regions and simultaneous comparisons of component means. The Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons. Familywise Error Rate and False Discovery Rate. Comparisons of several multivariate means. ANOVA and MANOVA. Inference for Linear Models. Beyond Ordinary Least Squares: ridge regression, lasso, regularized least Squares. Random effects and mixed effects linear models.
